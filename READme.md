# 🔐 Password Strength & Breach Checker

## 📌 Overview
The **Password Strength & Breach Checker** is a full-stack web application that helps users:
- Evaluate the strength of their passwords in real-time.
- Check if a password has been breached using the **HaveIBeenPwned API**.
- Save passwords (securely hashed) against different apps/websites in **MongoDB**.
- Receive **real-time breach alerts** via **Socket.io**.

This project was developed as part of SIT725, focusing on secure design, testing, and best practices for HD-level quality.
